The example programs of the previous sections provided little interaction with the user, if any at all. They 
simply printed simple values on screen, but the standard library provides many additional ways to interact 
with the user via its input/output features. This section will present a short introduction to some of the 
most useful.

C++ uses a convenient abstraction called streams to perform input and output operations in sequential media 
such as the screen, the keyboard or a file. A stream is an entity where a program can either insert or 
extract characters to/from. There is no need to know details about the media associated to the stream or any 
of its internal specifications. All we need to know is that streams are a source/destination of characters, 
and that these characters are provided/accepted sequentially (i.e., one after another).
